Its goal is to ease the working and manipulation of arrays, strings and such in PHP development. When I say redacted I mean that all methods were not just imported and converted blatantly — a lot of thought was put into removing methods that were unuseful to PHP developers, changing terms to make them less confusing in a PHP world, and add a lot of new methods and helpers on top of a new elegant syntax.\r\nIt can be used both as a static class, and an Object-Oriented class, so both the following are valid :\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$array = array(1, 2, 3);\r\n\r\n// One-off calls to helpers\r\nUnderscore::map($array, function($value) { return $value * 2; })\r\nunderscore($array)->map(function($value) { return $value * 2; })\r\n\r\n// Or chain calls\r\nunderscore($array)->filter(...)->sort(...)->get(2)\r\nUnderscore::chain($array)->filter(...)->sort(...)->get(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also alias Underscore's core classes and call them at any time, this mostly provides syntaxic elegance :\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// One-off calls\r\nArrays::first(...)\r\nArrays::each(...)\r\nString::escape(...)\r\n\r\n// Chained calls\r\nArrays::from($array)->filter(...)->get(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt comes with a config file that allows you to alias the main class to whatever you want, the default being `Underscore` and the most common probably being `__` (which is already taken in **Laravel** by the translation helper).\r\nYou can also give custom aliases to all of Underscore's methods, in said config file. Just add entries to the `aliases` option, the key being the alias, and the value the method to point to.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can find a detailed summary of all classes and methods in the [repo's wiki][]\r\n\r\n## About underscore.php\r\n\r\nThere is technically another port of Underscore.js to PHP available [on Github][] — I first discovered it when I saw it was for a time used on Laravel 4. I quickly grew disapoint of what a mess the code was, the lack of updates, and the 1:1 mentality that went behind it.\r\nThis revamped Underscore.php doesn't aim to be a direct port of Underscore.js. It sometimes omits methods that aren't relevant to PHP developers, rename others to match terms that are more common to them, provides a richer syntax and leaves room for future methods to be added all the time — whereas the previous port quickly recoded all JS methods to PHP and left it at that.\r\n\r\n[repo's wiki]: https://github.com/Anahkiasen/underscore-php/wiki\r\n[on Github]: https://github.com/brianhaveri/Underscore.php\r\n","tagline":"A PHP port of Underscore.js"}
